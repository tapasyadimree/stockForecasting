Stock Market Forecasting Using Machine Learning Models

The convergence of financial markets and machine learning technologies has spurred innovative 
approaches in forecasting stock market trends. This project delves into the realm of predictive 
analytics, employing various machine learning models to forecast stock market behavior. Through 
the utilization of historical stock data, a comprehensive analysis is conducted to evaluate the 
efficacy of diverse algorithms in predicting market fluctuations.

The study encompasses the implementation and comparison of machine learning methodologies,
such as ARIMA, Moving average model, Linear regression model. Each model's performance is 
rigorously assessed using relevant metrics to ascertain its accuracy, robustness, and applicability to 
real-world scenarios.
