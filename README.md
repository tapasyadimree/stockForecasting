Stock Market Forecasting Using Machine Learning Models

The convergence of financial markets and machine learning technologies has spurred innovative 
approaches in forecasting stock market trends. This project delves into the realm of predictive 
analytics, employing various machine learning models to forecast stock market behavior. Through 
the utilization of historical stock data, a comprehensive analysis is conducted to evaluate the 
efficacy of diverse algorithms in predicting market fluctuations.

The study encompasses the implementation and comparison of machine learning methodologies,
such as ARIMA, Moving average model, Linear regression model. Each model's performance is 
rigorously assessed using relevant metrics to ascertain its accuracy, robustness, and applicability to 
real-world scenarios.

This study delves deep into this intersection, focusing on the application 
of machine learning models in predicting stock market trends, specifically utilizing historical Apple 
stock data spanning from 2001 to 2023 sourced from Kaggle.

The primary objective of this study is two-fold. Firstly, it aims to harness the capabilities of three 
distinct machine learning models – Linear Regression, Moving Average, and ARIMA – to forecast 
future trends in Apple's stock prices. Secondly, it endeavors to discern the most effective and 
precise model among these three, thereby facilitating a rigorous comparative analysis grounded in 
error parameters and performance metrics
